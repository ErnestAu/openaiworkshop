What's really important with the cardio is just raising your heart rate above baseline by a considerable degree. I mean, you want to be in at least maybe low to mid-hundreds, and then just do whatever you're doing to get your heart rate that high for fucking 20-30 minutes. So when you say, like, oh, I play basketball after I lift, and I break a sweater, you know, I do soccer, that's fucking cardio. You know, you don't have to just sit on the bike. But I think, well actually I don't think I know that if on a daily basis, you raise your fucking heart rate up for a reasonable amount of time, maybe, I say 20, I probably really mean more like 30 minutes, then I think it's going to be fucking good for you. Better metabolism, you're not going to get so gassed, because your cardio is just going to be better from doing it, right? So that's really the part which kind of translates to better gains for me, the better metabolism and the better cardio, because that means it's going to be easier for me to get food down. You know, when people say, like, why would you do cardio on a bulk? Then you're going to have to eat more food to counteract the amount of energy that you just burned. I mean, you're right. But in practice, it's not like that's a problem. You know, by doing that 300 calories worth of cardio, or, you know, whatever value it actually ends up being, you're creating a fucking need in your body, where you're going to want to eat more calories to kind of fucking compensate. So you're not going to have trouble getting down an extra 300 calories worth of food just because you burned 300 calories on the bike. You know, I think that's just a... that's just a... what's the word I'm trying to think of? A mindset or sort of a piece of logic which stems from just looking for an excuse not to do it. You know, so... Can't overstate it. Cannot freaking overstate it. 30 minutes of cardio, ideally daily, but, you know, if you do it every so often, that's still better than nothing.
